Hi Grid !! .. and Hello World !!!

For long I had the desire to have a blogging site where I could analyze and document my own thoughts. I have been placing them on my Facebook pages and was told by my kids and friends that it was a bad idea.

Let me hope that my blogging efforts on The Grid will be met with with more favorable humor and the world would be wiser about the inner workings of my mind!!!
